# Customer churn prediction

*Churn* is a measure of how many customers stop using a service or product, often evaluated for a specific period of time. One of the biggest difficulties in telecommunication industry is to retain the customers and prevent the churn.

Customers in the telecom industry can choose from a variety of service providers and actively switch from one to the next. Acquiring new customers is not only more difficult, but also much more costly to companies than maintaining existing customer relationships. Therefore, many *Customer Churn Prediction* (CCP) models have been implemented.

In this study, a churn level prediction process is carried out using machine learning. A dataset with over 7000 customers of a telecom company is used. An action plan for the company is designed based on the results.
